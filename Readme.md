This LiveCode plugin helps to maintain uniformity of appearance of controls, 
allowing you to get and set object properties, and transfer properties between objects, 
using drag and drop, You can drag onto an object in a stack or its listing in the 
Application Browser [or, for DP8.12 into the Project Browser]. You can
also keep lists of favorite settings for colors, text, buttons, fields, graphic effects 
and custom keys.

Copy the stack into your LiveCode Plugins folder.
